# JavaScript OOP Principles - Beginner Practice Repository

This repository contains my practice code for learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in JavaScript. As a beginner, Iâ€™m focusing on understanding key OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## Contents

- **Classes and Objects:** Introduction to creating classes, instantiating objects, and using constructors.
- **Encapsulation:** Understanding the concept of private and public properties/methods, using getter and setter methods.
- **Inheritance:** Creating class hierarchies and using inheritance to reuse code.
- **Polymorphism:** Implementing method overriding and achieving polymorphic behavior.
- **Abstraction:** Creating abstract classes or methods and understanding how abstraction works in OOP.
- **Basic Examples:** Simple examples demonstrating how to apply each of the OOP principles in JavaScript.

## Learning Progress

- **Completed:** Basic classes, objects, constructor methods, and inheritance.
- **Ongoing:** Understanding and applying encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- **Upcoming:** Advanced OOP features, design patterns, and working on bigger projects using OOP principles.
